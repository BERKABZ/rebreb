            Bengkat, just a simple message for you. It's our special day. No long sweet messages can express how much I love you. I'm so blessed and grateful for having you, one of the best things that happened in my life. I just want you to know, no matter what happens, I will always stay the same and will always love you through ups and downs. I will never get tired of loving you.

Thank you for reminding me how valuable I am. Thank you for treating me gently and softly. Thank you for understanding my busy days too. I've learned to love you so deeply, I have learned to dream about more things in the future with you. Thank you for making me feel those kinds of emotions and feelings.
